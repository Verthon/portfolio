## How to Measure ESLint Execution Time
</DevBiteHeader>

<DevBiteContent>

**Last updated**: 03.08.2024

**Context**:

- Environment: SPA React Application
- Dependencies:
  - ESLint version: `"eslint": "8.56.0"`

**Problem**:

Determine which ESLint rules are slowing down your project.

**Solution:**

Add a new command that lists the least performant rules first



```json
// in package.json "scripts" section
"lint:performance": "TIMING=1 eslint --ext .ts,.tsx .",
```

It will print out something like this in your terminal:
```bash
Rule                              | Time (ms) | Relative
:---------------------------------|----------:|--------:
import/no-cycle                   |  1985.921 |    81.4%
import/namespace                  |   285.814 |    11.7%
@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars |    45.128 |     1.8%
react/display-name                |    25.642 |     1.1%
import/no-unresolved              |    18.698 |     0.8%
react/no-direct-mutation-state    |    11.240 |     0.5%
react/require-render-return       |     8.157 |     0.3%
react/prop-types                  |     6.825 |     0.3%
react/jsx-no-target-blank         |     3.364 |     0.1%
react/no-deprecated               |     2.761 |     0.1%
```

In my case it turns out that `import/no-cycle` is the most resource-intensive rule.
With that said, we need to make a decision, either:
* disable the rule and run it separately manually e.g `"lint:import-no-cycle": "eslint --rule 'import/no-cycle:error' --ext .ts,.tsx ."`
* leave it as is if the cost is acceptable
* find a faster and compliant alternative to ESLint like: [OxLint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) or [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)

Both options have it's own trade-offs and it should be discussed with the team, which approach is best under specific circumstances.
