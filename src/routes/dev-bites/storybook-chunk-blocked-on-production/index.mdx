## Storybook chunk blocked by network policy
</DevBiteHeader>

**Last updated**: 06.03.2023

**Context**:

- Environment: SPA React Application with Webpack as a bundler
- Dependencies:
  - Webpack version: `"webpack": "5.82.0"`
  - Storybook version: `"storybook": "7.5.3"`

**Problem**:

Storybook creates a chunk that has `~` mark in the chunk-name - this could be considered as illegal character in URL (blacklisted at network level).

**Root cause:**

By default, Storybook generates its main chunk with Webpack using the pattern: `'[name].[contenthash:8].iframe.bundle.js'`. This results in chunk names such as `runtime~main.35339373.iframe.bundle.js`, where the tilde can be problematic.

**Solution:**

Simply remove `[name]` part from filename - since we donâ€™t have control over it.

```bash
// .storybook/main.ts or main.js

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  webpackFinal: async (config) => {
	  config.output = {
		  ...config.output,
      filename: '[contenthash:8].iframe.bundle.js',
	  }
    return config;
  },
}
```
