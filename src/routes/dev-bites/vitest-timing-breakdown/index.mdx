**Last updated**: 22.12.2024

**Context**:

- Environment: SPA React Application with Vitest test runner
- Dependencies:
  - Vitest version: `"vitest": "2.1.8"`

**Problem**:

Vitest after running tests prints out the `Duration` in the following format:

<Alert variant="info" marginBottomInRems={1}>
  This data is from a real-world large project.
</Alert>

```bash
Test Files 424 passed | 1 skipped(425)
  Tests    1235 passed | 5 skipped (1240)
 Duration  285.14s (transform 9.01s, setup 2273.07s, collect 37.69s, tests 133.60s, environment 41.95s, prepare 19.43s)
```

Vitest Team provide basic information about it in their [docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/profiling-test-performance.html#profiling-test-performance)

**Solution:**

Basic breakdown:

1. `setup`: sum of all `setupFiles` elements of your Vitest config file,run for each test file
2. `collect`: file-system scan to gather your test files and import their dependencies
3. `tests`: time for running only the tests
4. `transform`: how long it takes for Vitest to transform files (source and tests)
5. `environment`: overhead for loading the environment (importing jsdom/happy-dom/node)
6. `prepare`: Vitest's internal tasks (setup cache, linking tests files)

Where to search for execution time improvements:

  Please, measure before optimizing:
  https://vitest.dev/guide/profiling-test-performance.html
</Alert>

1. `setup`:

- try to move parts of the setup into a global setup/teardown if possible
- try to run global fixtures once before all tests, instead of before each test

2. `collect`:

- keep `testMatch`, `include` and `exclude` precis, to avoid scanning unnecessary files.
- in case you have a custom `exclude` or `include` make sure you are using: `import { configDefaults } from 'vitest/config'`

3. `tests`:

- refactor or remove slow or redundant tests
- migrate the large DOM tests to tools like Cypress, Playwright, or Storybook UI Testing

4. `transform`:

- investigate barrel-files transformations (they might pull entire module)
- investigate if tweaking babel/swc/typescript setup will help
- investigate [optimizeDeps](https://vitest.dev/config/#deps-optimizer) in the config

5. `environment`:

- if you run your tests with Web API simulations, consider using happy-dom instead of JSDom
- discover if setting the different environment in specific tests will improve performance (e.g. when using global jsdom, use node in test without need for jsdom)

6. `prepare`:

- reducing the amount of the dependencies used in the project is always beneficial
- check for the circular dependencies in the project

To improve the performance you can check the [dedicated docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/improving-performance.html) on the Vitest documentation
