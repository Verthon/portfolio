**Status:** Experimental (since 2022)

**Recommendation** Just use the stable [Vitest Browser](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/) (Starting from Vitest v4)

<Heading tag="h2" id="overview">Overview</Heading>

- Cross-framework support (React, Vue, Svelte)
- Real browser testing environment
- Unified tooling with E2E tests (Playwright becomes a E2E standard nowadays)

<Heading tag="h2" id="known-issues-and-tradeoffs">Known Issues & Tradeoffs</Heading>

- **Unstable API**: It's still experimental, things are expected to be breaking
- **Lack of the clear MVP plan**: All the information is scattered in many Github Issues
- **Lack of a clear roadmap**: Playwright does not share any [public roadmaps](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/17409)
- **Rely on prod build**: Currently doesn't support HMR and watch mode, not really friendly for gigantic apps with slow build times
- **Code coverage**: No support yet like in the Jest/Vitest

<Heading tag="h2" id="adoption-considerations">Adoption Considerations</Heading>

- **New Projects**: Consider waiting for beta/stable release
- **Existing Projects**: Consider waiting for stable release
- Just use the stable Vitest Browser (Starting from Vitest v4)

There are also great alternatives, that allow testing components in real browser:

- [Cypress Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/app/component-testing/get-started)
- [Storybook Component Testing](https://sordyl.dev/blog/storybook-testing-overview/)
- [Vitest Browser](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/)
