**Status:** Alpha version (public alpha launch December 2024)

  Overview
</Heading>

- Unstyled components library with around 25+ components available at the moment (more to come)
- From creators of successful UI libraries: Mui, Radix,Floating UI
- Naming is quite unfortunate, since first results in Google lead to the deprecated `@mui/base` [it is confusing for users](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues/1176)
- Team is full committed [full-time for the long-term](https://bsky.app/profile/vladmoroz.bsky.social/post/3lcg2iz35v22q)
- Focused on accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus management, contrast, labeling)
- Roadmap available [here](https://github.com/orgs/mui/projects/1/views/13)

  Known Issues & Tradeoffs
</Heading>

- **Unstable API**: It's still very early phase, things are expected to [be breaking](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22breaking%20change%22)
- **Using dreaded barrel export** [index](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/blob/master/packages/react/src/index.ts) [package.json](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/blob/master/packages/react/package.json#L29) if you are curious why it is bad you can read it [here](https://dev.to/thepassle/a-practical-guide-against-barrel-files-for-library-authors-118c)
- **Bundle size to be improved** it is connected to the previous point, but there are some duplications between dependencies [issue](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues/1246)

<Heading tag="h2" id="adoption-considerations">
  Adoption Considerations
</Heading>

- **New Projects**: Consider waiting for beta release
- **Existing Projects**: Most likely not needed anymore unless you planning adding new components / creating a design-system as separate package
