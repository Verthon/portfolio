**Status:** Technical Preview (since October 2025)

<Heading tag="h2" id="overview" linkLabel='Link to heading: Overview'>Overview</Heading>

Oxlint now supports JavaScript-based plugins, letting you extend the linter while retaining near-Rust performance.

<Heading tag="h2" id="known-issues-and-tradeoffs" linkLabel="Link to heading: Known Issues & Tradeoffs">Known Issues & Tradeoffs</Heading>

- This initial release does not implement all of ESLint's plugin API
- Performance is good, but it's going to get way better
- Known issues for Windows users (who is using Windows for web-dev ?)
- It can't be as fast as native Oxlint rules and plugins

<Heading tag="h2" id="adoption-considerations" linkLabel="Link to heading: Adoption Considerations">Adoption Considerations</Heading>

- **New Projects**: Adopt if you mostly rely on built-in rules. Avoid heavy ESLint plugin assumptions
- **Existing Projects**: In case you have huge pile of ESLint plugins, consider waiting for stable release. Consider integrating the https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-oxlint to offload rules Oxlint already supports while keeping ESLint for the rest.
