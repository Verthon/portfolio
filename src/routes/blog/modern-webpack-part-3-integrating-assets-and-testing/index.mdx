**Recap of Part 2**: In the previous installment, we integrated Babel and React into our Webpack setup, enhancing our modern SPA boilerplate.
We configured Babel to support the latest JavaScript features, TypeScript, and React JSX.
Additionally, we implemented environment variable management using dotenv and refined our Webpack configuration for handling .tsx files.

For unit tests we will use Jest which is one of most popular solutions on the market.

**Install following dev-dependencies**:

```shell
npm i -D jest @types/jest @swc/core @swc/jest
```

**Jest configuration file** Create `jest.config.js` in the root of the project.
Following config will tell jest to transform `ts|js|tsx|jsx` files with `swc-jest`

<Alert variant="danger" marginBottomInRems={1}>
  **Note:** swc-jest does not perform type checking in your tests.
</Alert>

```javascript
// jest.config.js
/** @type {import('@jest/types').Config.InitialOptions} */
const config = {
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(t|j)sx?$': '@swc/jest',
  },
  resetMocks: true,
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/testSetup.ts'],
  verbose: true,
}

module.exports = config
```

**Environment Configuration for Testing**
Introduce an `env.test` file to manage test-specific environment variables:

```
//.env.test

ENVIRONMENT_NAME=test
```

**Setting Up Environment Variables**: Configure a setup file to load the appropriate environment variables before all tests:

```typescript
// test.setup.ts
import { loadEnvs } from './config/env'

beforeAll(() => {
  process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test'

  loadEnvs()
})
```

**Verify Environment Configuration**
In order to confirm the behaviour of loading test envs we could create a dummy test

```typescript
// src/example.spec.ts
describe('example unit test', () => {
  it('should have the NODE_ENV equal to test', () => {
    expect(process.env.NODE_ENV).toBe('test')
  })
})
```

**Commands for Running Tests**: Update `package.json` with commands to run and clear the Jest cache:

```json
"test:unit": "jest",
"test:unit:clear": "jest --clearCache"
```

Now the tests can be executed by typing: `npm run test:unit` in the terminal

**Key points**

- the Jest setup is tailored for TypeScript files within the Node.js environment (Jest's default setting)
- the setup can be easily extended with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to cover component tests as well, however it is good to explore alternatives first ðŸ‘‡
- especially tools that allow testing in the browser like:
  - [Cypress Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview)
  - [Storybook Testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests)
  - [SafeTest](https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-safetest-a-novel-approach-to-front-end-testing-37f9f88c152d)
  - [Playright Component Testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components)
- from my experience in large applications developers often encounter performance issues with React Testing Library due to the rendering of extensive DOM trees and scanning through it.
- additionally in heavy integration tests Playright or Cypress combined with [msw](https://mswjs.io/docs/integrations/node) for network call interception, tend to perform more efficiently

  Asset handling
</Heading>

Webpack simplifies the management of static assets, all we need to do is to extend `webpack.config.ts` - module.rules

```typescript
// webpack.config.ts
module: {
  rules: [
    // ... rest of the previous config
    {
      test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
      type: 'asset/resource',
    },
    {
      test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
      type: 'asset/resource',
    },
  ]
}
```

`asset/resource` will emit the file in the production bundle, this is beneficial because:

- it won't bloat JavaScript bundle size
- browsers can cache each asset independently
- emited file will include hash and filename for cache-busting

<Heading tag="h2" id="css-setup">
  CSS setup
</Heading>

Frontend applications are incomplete without styling. To efficiently manage CSS files within a Webpack build, we need to update config.

Install following dependencies:

```bash
npm i -D style-loader css-loader postcss-loader mini-css-extract-plugin css-minimizer-webpack-plugin postcss postcss-preset-env autoprefixer
```

- style-loader: Injects CSS into the DOM via `<style>` tags, useful during development for hot module replacement.
- css-loader: Resolves @import and url() within CSS files as module dependencies, enabling them to be bundled by Webpack.
- postcss-loader: Integrates PostCSS into the build process, allowing for CSS transformations using plugins.
- MiniCssExtractPlugin: Extracts CSS into separate files, ideal for production builds to leverage browser caching.
- CssMinimizerPlugin: Optimizes and minifies CSS, enhancing load times and efficiency in production.
- postcss: Facilitates the use of advanced CSS through plugins like autoprefixer and postcss-preset-env.
- postcss-preset-env: Allows the use of future CSS features by compiling them to compatible code today.
- autoprefixer: Automatically applies vendor prefixes to CSS rules, ensuring cross-browser compatibility based on "Can I Use" data.

Create dedicated file for post-css configuration to not bloat Webpack config file

```javascript
/**
 * @type {import('postcss').ProcessOptions}
 */
const config = {
  plugins: [['postcss-preset-env', 'autoprefixer']],
}

module.exports = config
```

Lastly the webpack config has to be updated with loaders that were installed previously to handle CSS in JS files.
In `module.rules` add yet another loaders for css and post-css.

<Alert variant="info" marginBottomInRems={1}>
  **Note** We only want to extract the CSS to dedicated files on production
  build.
</Alert>

```typescript
// webpack.config.ts
module: {
  rules: [
    // ... rest of the previous config
    {
      test: /\.css$/i,
      use: [
        mode === 'production' ? MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader : 'style-loader',
        'css-loader',
        'postcss-loader',
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

Additionally new plugins has to be initialized in the `plugins` array. Additionally we want to run those optimizations only on production builds.

```
// webpack.config.ts
import MiniCssExtractPlugin from "mini-css-extract-plugin";
import CssMinimizerPlugin from "css-minimizer-webpack-plugin";

plugins: [
  mode === "production" && new MiniCssExtractPlugin(),
	mode === "production" && new CssMinimizerPlugin(),
]
```

<Heading tag="h2" id="bundle-size-observability">
  Bundle size observability

Applications bundle size tend to grow really fast, it is good idea to observe frequently how much our chunks weight.
Webpack offers advanced plugin to visualize bundle size in a graphical format.

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm i -D webpack-bundle-analyzer @types/webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

**Optimize build commands**:

- regular build, which is faster and can run without issues in the pipelines
- build-analyze for devs to check the bundle size using `webpack-bundle-analyzer`

Add the following command to your `package.json`, utilizing the `ANALYZE_BUILD` environment variable to toggle the analysis mode:

```json
"build:analyze": "ANALYZE_BUILD=true npm run build",
```

**Configure Webpack**:
Modify your Webpack configuration to conditionally include the BundleAnalyzerPlugin based on the ANALYZE_BUILD flag.

```typescript
// webpack.config.ts
import { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } from 'webpack-bundle-analyzer'

const createBundleAnalyzerConfig = () => {
  const isAnalyzeMode = process.env.ANALYZE_BUILD === 'true'
  const config: BundleAnalyzerPlugin['opts'] = isAnalyzeMode
    ? { analyzerMode: 'server' }
    : { analyzerMode: 'disabled' }

  return config
}

const bundleAnalyzerConfig = createBundleAnalyzerConfig()

// in the createWebpackConfig function
plugins: [
  //... rest of the config

  mode === 'production' && new BundleAnalyzerPlugin(bundleAnalyzerConfig),
]
```

**Execution**:

- Run `npm run build` for a standard build, suitable for deployment and CI environments like GitHub Actions.
- Use npm run `build:analyze` to launch a server that provides a detailed breakdown of the bundle, enabling developers to visually assess which parts are contributing most to the size.

This setup ensures that developers have the tools needed to maintain optimal performance and manageability of application bundles efficiently.

That concludes this part. You can review all the details in following PR: https://github.com/Verthon/webpack-react-boilerplate/pull/3/files

Thank you, any feedback is highly appreciated.
