Measuring the package-size and it's impact for our project bundle is very important.  
Bundlephobia is a popular tool used to analyze the size of packages before adding them to a project. However, it has limitations in terms of accuracy and functionality.  
This article explores alternative tools that can provide more comprehensive insights into bundle size analysis.

[Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/date-fns@4.1.0) outputs the **entire** size of the package. It is not taking into account of what user is actually importing from it.  
It gives a good idea of what to expect from the scanned package:
- whether it is tree-shakeable or not
- whether it has a side-effects
- how many dependencies does this package use

<Heading tag='h3' id='bundlephobia-only-approach'>Bundlephobia only approach may lead to overestimates</Heading>

Since it outputs the entire package size, the devs may reject packages based on hasty flat size check.

Tool made by [Hiroki](https://hirok.io/) author of many great packages like: [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) [get-tsconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-tsconfig)
It is using [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/) to install packages in the browser.

- you can install multiple packages at once
- shows all of the dependencies of the package
- shows what module system the library exposes (cjs/esm)
- shows if given packages ship the types
- allow to download the build for further analysis

I have checked the `date-fns` `format` util - it correctly shows its real weight: 5.7kB (gzipped)

The only downside I found is fact, that rarely it falls into some infinite loop, however refreshing the site always resolves the issue.

Tool made by [Okiki Ojo](https://okikio.dev)  
It also installs the dependencies in the browser. It is not as detailed as the pkg-size.

- you can install multiple packages at once
- sharing feature through the url [date-fns analysis share link](https://bundlejs.com/?q=date-fns%404.1.0&treeshake=%5B%7B+format+%7D%5D)
- shows the real package size based on the import
- shows the build outcome
- allow to tweak the bundler to your needs

I have checked the `date-fns` `format` util - it correctly shows it's real weight: 5.7kB (gzipped)  

Sometimes it cannot fetch the dependecy (in my case was the rare case scenario). [Related Github issue](https://github.com/okikio/bundlejs/issues/70)

<Heading tag='h2' id='date-fns-example'>Example with date-fns analysis</Heading>

The date-fns is well-known modular and modern date utility library. It is fully tree-shakeable and fits great for our example.  
For our experiment, we will assume that our application needs just the formatting date functionality.  
Additionally, the `format` function will be imported from the root-entry point `import { format }  from 'date-fns'`  
We know from the Bundlephobia that package:
- is tree-shakeable
- has 0 dependencies
- has no side-effects

The **entire** package (minified + gzipped) weight around 17.5kB

Both `pkg-size` and `bundlejs` outputs correct bundle size impact (5.7kB gzipped) when pulling just `format` from `date-fns`.  
Moreover, both solutions add more insights and result-sharing capabilities for your Team.

<Heading tag='h2' id='summary'>Summary</Heading>

Bundlephobia is still a great tool for the **initial** research, it load really fast, tells most important info about package health right away (tree-shakeable, side-effect, dependencies count).  
The final decision should be made based on either: [pkg-size](https://pkg-size.dev/) or [bundlejs](https://bundlejs.com/)  
These tools allow for dynamic analysis based on actual imports, providing a more accurate picture of the real cost of adding a package to your project.  
Pkg-size and Bundlejs can help in collaborative environments due to their sharing features.
Since it is highly unlikely from my experience to leverage 100% of the functionality of the library.  
I will still use Bundlephobia as a preliminary tool to check the initial package's health. Then I would use the `pkg-size` with its deep analysis to make the final decision.
