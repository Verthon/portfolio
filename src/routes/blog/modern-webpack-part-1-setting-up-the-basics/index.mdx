Building a Modern React SPA Boilerplate with Webpack 5, Part 1: Setting Up the Basics

### What is Webpack

Webpack is static module bundler - it basically takes your modules (needed to run your app) and turn them into one or more bundles, which are simply static assets.

Bundler starts with scanning your modules, in order to create something called `dependency-graph` . This way Webpack will know, which modules and libraries are needed for the entry-point for your application.

### Core concepts

- Entry - module, where Webpack starts building dependency-graph, in React apps it is often index.ts/js file which imports bootstrap file
- Output - location where Webpack should place the final bundle
- Loaders - allow Webpack to process files with extensions other than JavaScript and JSON (JSX transformations, CSS, Fonts loaders, Babel transformations)
- Plugins - plugins will handle the additional performance optimizations, environment variables, Module Federation etc.
- Mode - tells Webpack, if you are in dev mode or production, where bundler apply all of its environment based optimizations

### Why Webpack ?

You might be wondering why to use Webpack nowadays, especially with many new bundlers emerging ? There are multiple advantages to still use Webpack:

- Webpack huge ecosystem of loaders and plugins, battle-proven with big community
- Highly customizable with great documentation
- Framework agnostic - in this guide we use React - but bundler is completely separated from the any framework
- Advanced code-splitting and lazy loading with Webpack Magic comments (https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments) fetch priorities (https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#webpackfetchpriority) and many more advanced features
- Module Federation - this topic is very advanced and dedicated rather for big projects - to learn more please refer to this fantastic article: https://scriptedalchemy.medium.com/understanding-webpack-module-federation-a-deep-dive-efe5c55bf366

### Setting up npm

Now we need put the concepts into minimal webpack setup. We assume that repository with initialized npm setup is there. The goal for this section is to:

- ensure devs working on this project will have Node v20 LTS
- install needed npm packages
- add basic TypeScript setup
- create Webpack setup function
- create build script
- prepare environment variables config

### Unified Node version

We always want to use Node 20 in this repository. To enforce this, create a new file named `.nvmrc`Run the following command to enforce the use of exact package versions within the project.

```bash
echo "v20" > .nvmrc
```

Whenever someone using NVM navigate to this project, it will automatically switch to Node 20.

Sometimes it may not work automatically, so it is a good practice to always use `nvm use` before you run npm install command.

### Additional setup for npm

Run this command to enforce exact versions of packages that will be installed inside of the project.

```bash
echo engine-strict = true > .npmrc
echo save-prefix="" >> .npmrc
```

Additionally it is good practice to add engines to package.json to make our lives easier on CICD and deployments

```bash
"engines": {
  "node": "20"
 },
```

### Install dependencies

To use Webpack, it is necessary to install it as a dependency in our project, along with some helper packages needed for TypeScript.

```bash
npm i -D webpack webpack-cli typescript ts-node @types/node @types/webpack
```

### Base tsconfig.json

I strongly recommend fantastic TypeScript resources available on: [https://www.totaltypescript.com](https://www.totaltypescript.com/)

For this boilerplate, the bundler setup will do the job. Create a `tsconfig.json` file with the following content (Reference: [TypeScript Configurations Cheat Sheet](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet)):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Base Options: */
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "target": "es2022",
    "allowJs": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "isolatedModules": true,
    /* Strictness */
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "composite": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    /* If NOT transpiling with TypeScript: */
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "noEmit": true,
    /* If your code runs in the DOM: */
    "lib": ["es2022", "dom", "dom.iterable"]
  }
}
```

### Add minimal Webpack build configuration

Next, create a configuration file for Webpack - `webpack.config.ts` - in the root of the project:

```tsx
import path from 'path'
import type { Configuration } from 'webpack'

const createWebpackConfig = (mode: Configuration['mode']): Configuration => {
  return {
    mode: mode,
    entry: path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'src/index.js'),
    resolve: {
      extensions: ['.js'],
    },
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'dist'),
      clean: true,
    },
  }
}

export default createWebpackConfig
```

We take advantage of having function as configuration over object to be able to customize our scripts later on.

- mode for production will be set always to `production` - this allow Webpack to make its optimizations for production build
- entry points to entry file index.js
- output is set to the `dist` folder, we also pass `clean` property, to remove old dist folder whenever you are creating new build

### Example entry file and build command

For now, we can stick with a basic `index.js` file to simply test the build command.

```tsx
//src/index.js

export const printHelloWorld = () => {
  return 'hello world'
}

console.log(printHelloWorld())
```

Last but not least the build command and dedicated script:

```tsx
// scripts/build.ts

import createWebpackConfig from '../webpack.config'

export default () => {
  return createWebpackConfig('production')
}
```

Build command in package.json

```tsx
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --config scripts/build.ts"
}
```

Now by running `npm run build` new folder `dist` should be created with following file in it:

```tsx
//dist/main.
;(() => {
  'use strict'
  console.log('hello world')
})()
```

That concludes this part. You can review all the details in following PR: https://github.com/Verthon/webpack-react-boilerplate/pull/1/files

We now have a minimal setup, which we will extend with useful React-based features in the next article. In upcoming part we will focus on:

- setting up modern Babel configuration
- adding React
- creating dev-server configuration
- extending Webpack plugins

Thank you, any feedback is highly appreciated.
