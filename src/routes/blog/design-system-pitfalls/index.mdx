Big platform for managing and creating establishments
- 10+ million users 
- 35+ frontend apps
- 300+ developers from multiple companies
- 110+ components in the single design-system package
- Single Page Application based frontend architecture

My team didn’t own the design-system. We worked as a frontend platform team, enabling product (stream-aligned) teams to focus on their product, rather than the surrounding infrastructure.  
We were the first integrators of the DS. A ~1-year early-adopter phase helped us to establish list of the DS gaps.

<Heading tag="h2" id="design-system-goals">Design system goals</Heading>

What the DS must deliver for the business, not the tools. These goals define what 'good' looks like and what we hold the DS accountable for.

- Consistent UI/UX across the entire platform
- Faster time-to-market for product (stream-aligned) teams
- Lower total cost of ownership through reusable building blocks
- WCAG compliance and reduced legal/brand risk
- Scales to new brands and markets (multi-brand ready)
- Faster onboarding and practical accessibility training

<Heading tag="h2" id="design-system-pitfalls">Pitfalls</Heading>

Observed pitfalls, with focus on impact and how we know (verifiability).

<Heading tag="h3" id="organizational-pitfalls">Organizational pitfalls</Heading>

Governance and collaboration gaps that fragment the system and slow delivery

- Missing clear OKRs/KPIs for the design system
- Components introduced outside DS review (service designers bypass the core team)
- Figma files use frames instead of library components (version/variants/tokens mismatch)
- Teams “hack” the DS without reporting (local wrappers/style overrides)
- No contribution model; core DS team reduced to two people
- Unclear inclusion criteria for what belongs in the DS
- Release cadence mismatched with product teams (biweekly)
- Component sprawl (110+), risk of a “design-system ghost town”

<Heading tag="h3" id="technical-pitfalls">Technical pitfalls</Heading>

- CSS-in-JS usage forces consumers to pin exact peer versions
  - Not micro-frontends-friendly: singleton/peer mismatches across host/remotes
- No browser-based tests
- a11y checks not enforced and automated in tests
- No bundle-size guardrails (no budgets)
- Weak semver discipline: breaking behavioral changes shipped as minors; missing migration guidance
- Slow/stale dependency updates (security/perf risk)
- CSR-only / SSR-unsafe: direct browser API usage 

<Heading tag="h2" id="potential-quick-wins">Potential quick wins</Heading>

Changes that I think may have the best ROI for the Team as it is right now.

- Enforce proper SemVer ASAP - to regain developers trust and encourage upgrades
- Establish browser-based tests for the most-used, bug-prone components - to reduce the regressions
- Ensure designers use Figma library components that match tokens

What actually worked and what to avoid next time.


<Heading tag="h3" id="lessons-learned-what-worked">
  What worked
</Heading>

- Storybook as single source of documentation
  - Tokens
  - Components with their APIs
  - Overview of how and when to use given component, best practices (a11y, error, loading states) etc.
  - Getting started
  - Architecture Decision Records
  - Size of the preview aligned with organization responsive breakpoints
  - Link to Figma designs that match given Component/Token
  - Changelog
- Reference app showcasing the real-world composition of components
- Support channels where devs could easily raise a bug or ask during office hours

<Heading tag="h3" id="lessons-learned-advice">
  Advice
</Heading>

- Hard pass on runtime CSS-in-JS when it must be a peer dependency
- Design tokens ideally must be framework-agnostic
- In Figma, use only library components - treat Figma and code as a shared language: `Figma = code`
- Keep the DS core intentionally small (focus on tokens + base UI; limit component count)
- Plan community contributions upfront using the ecosystem layers [Brad Frost Anatomy of a design system ecosystem](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-design-system-ecosystem/)
- Updating the dependencies as we develop, otherwise we end up with forced few majors upgrades
- Frequent releases adjusted to the consumer needs
- Clear roadmap and transparency about current and upcoming focus
- Quality over speed, by adding too many things, you are creating expectations hard to revert
- Common strategy and understanding of purpose, stakeholders should know what value DS brings
- Listen to your users, encourage an `Iterative improvement culture`
