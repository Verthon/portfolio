Big platform for managing and creating establishments
- 10+ million users 
- 35+ frontend apps
- 300+ developers from multiple companies
- 110+ components in the single design-system package
- Single Page Application based frontend architecture

My team didn’t own the design-system. We worked as a frontend platform team, enabling product (stream-aligned) teams to focus on their product, rather than the surrounding infrastructure.  
We were the first integrators of the DS. A ~1-year early-adopter phase helped us to establish list of the DS gaps.

What the DS must deliver for the business, not the tools. These goals define what 'good' looks like and what we hold the DS accountable for.

- Consistent UI/UX across the entire platform
- Faster time-to-market for product (stream-aligned) teams
- Lower total cost of ownership through reusable building blocks
- WCAG compliance and reduced legal/brand risk
- Scales to new brands and markets (multi-brand ready)
- Faster onboarding and practical accessibility training

Observed pitfalls, with focus on impact and how we know (verifiability).

Governance and collaboration gaps that fragment the system and slow delivery

- Missing clear OKRs/KPIs for the design system
- Components introduced outside DS review (service designers bypass the core team)
- Figma files use frames instead of library components (version/variants/tokens mismatch)
- Teams “hack” the DS without reporting (local wrappers/style overrides)
- No contribution model; core DS team reduced to two people
- Unclear inclusion criteria for what belongs in the DS
- Release cadence mismatched with product teams (biweekly)
- Component sprawl (110+), risk of a “design-system ghost town”

<Heading tag="h3" id="technical-pitfalls" linkLabel="Link to heading: Technical pitfalls">Technical pitfalls</Heading>

- CSS-in-JS usage forces consumers to pin exact peer versions
  - Not micro-frontends-friendly: singleton/peer mismatches across host/remotes
- No browser-based tests
- a11y checks not enforced and automated in tests
- No bundle-size guardrails (no budgets)
- Weak semver discipline: breaking behavioral changes shipped as minors; missing migration guidance
- Slow/stale dependency updates (security/perf risk)
- CSR-only / SSR-unsafe: direct browser API usage 

<Heading tag="h2" id="potential-quick-wins" linkLabel="Link to heading: Potential quick wins">Potential quick wins</Heading>

Changes that I think may have the best ROI for the Team as it is right now.

- Enforce proper SemVer ASAP - to regain developers trust and encourage upgrades
- Establish browser-based tests for the most-used, bug-prone components - to reduce the regressions
- Ensure designers use Figma library components that match tokens

What actually worked and what to avoid next time.


<Heading tag="h3" id="lessons-learned-what-worked" linkLabel="Link to heading: What worked">
  What worked
</Heading>

- Storybook as single source of documentation
  - Tokens
  - Components with their APIs
  - Overview of how and when to use given component, best practices (a11y, error, loading states) etc.
  - Getting started
  - Architecture Decision Records
  - Size of the preview aligned with organization responsive breakpoints
  - Link to Figma designs that match given Component/Token
  - Changelog
- Reference app showcasing the real-world composition of components
- Support channels where devs could easily raise a bug or ask during office hours

<Heading tag="h3" id="lessons-learned-advice" linkLabel="Link to heading: Advice">
  Advice
</Heading>

- Hard pass on runtime CSS-in-JS when it must be a peer dependency
- Design tokens ideally must be framework-agnostic
- In Figma, use only library components - treat Figma and code as a shared language: `Figma = code`
- Keep the DS core intentionally small (focus on tokens + base UI; limit component count)
- Plan community contributions upfront using the ecosystem layers [Brad Frost Anatomy of a design system ecosystem](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-design-system-ecosystem/)
- Updating the dependencies as we develop, otherwise we end up with forced few majors upgrades
- Frequent releases adjusted to the consumer needs
- Clear roadmap and transparency about current and upcoming focus
- Quality over speed, by adding too many things, you are creating expectations hard to revert
- Common strategy and understanding of purpose, stakeholders should know what value DS brings
- Listen to your users, encourage an `Iterative improvement culture`
