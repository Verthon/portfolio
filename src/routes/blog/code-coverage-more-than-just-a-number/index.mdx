Code coverage is a set of tools, that examine the percentages of code covered
by the tests. I’m working with Jest on daily basis, in this article I will use examples from this
test framework.

To run coverage report, you can use following command:

```bash
  jest --coverage
```

You can see the results right away in your terminal or open nicer GUI with coverage in `src/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

The metrics

- lines - simply how much of you code is taking part in the tests
- statements - same as above but it counts only instructions
- functions - how many functions were called during test
- branches - all branches of if/else, switches, conditional flows

Lets look at silly example:

```tsx
// Test case

describe('isErrorRoute - helper to determine if url from input is recognized as error route in routing', () => {
  it('should', () => {
    expect(isErrorRoute('https://example.com/error')).toEqual(true)
    expect(isErrorRoute('https://example.com/error/not-found')).toEqual(true)
  })
})

// Implementation

export const isErrorRoute = (url?: string) => {
  if (!url) {
    // 1. branch not covered
    // 2. both 'statements' in line 4 and 5 also not covered
    console.log('statement')
    return false
  }

  return url.includes('/error')
}
```

And the test with following metrics

- lines - 60% (3/5)
- statements - 66.66% (4/6)
- functions - 100% (1/1)
- branches - 0% (0/1)

<Heading tag='h2' id='what-information-code-coverage-gives-us'>What information code coverage gives us ?</Heading>

- what parts of application are not covered with tests at all
- acts as a general guide for further analysis, where there might a be a real need of adding tests

<Heading tag='h2' id='what-information-code-coverage-wont-give-you'>What information code coverage won’t give you</Heading>

- how much behavior is covered
- it tell you nothing about overall tests quality
- covering code with tests ≠= covering functionality with tests

<Heading tag='h2' id='the-code-coverage-requirements'>The code coverage requirements</Heading>

Most of the times there is requirement of having 80% code coverage in order to add new functionality to the codebase.

While I can understand the purpose of it, there is a huge chance, that some developers may focus solely on meeting the 80% threshold, without considering the real purpose of testing.

Common gotchas to spot on for “80% threshold focused” devs:

- Over-reliance on mocks and stubs
- No assertions in the tests
- Writing many very similar tests
- Ignoring code paths that are difficult to test (which may be a crucial parts for functionality)
- Testing implementation details rather than behavior
