## Pnpm basics - how to transition quickly
</ArticleHeader>

<ArticleContent>
### What is pnpm ?
A package manager that aims to be:
* fast
* efficient on node_modules size
* strict

Let's break this down:

Due to efficient centralized store management, `pnpm` is expected to be up to 2x faster than `npm`.

- pnpm writes one unique file only ever once on your disk
- pnpm uses a different (very complex) algorithm to fetch and resolve the dependencies of your project

To understand better the motivation behind the pnpm, please refer to the [official docs](https://pnpm.io/motivation)

### Why pnpm is faster

The traditional way of installing dependencies with `npm` contains 3 stages:

- resolving
- fetching
- linking

As a result, everything lands in the `node_modules` of your project.
Npm proceeds with each stage at the time, so `fetching` has to wait for the `resolving` step and so on.

Pnpm on the other hand runs the installation stages separately for each dependency.  
Once a package is resolved, it immediately starts to fetch it.

For more benchmarks, you can check the [official pnpm benchmarks](https://pnpm.io/benchmarks)

### Small node_modules

Packages files are stored in a central content-addressable store.  
Any project can access this store. Only files, that are different between package versions will be added to the store.  
Letâ€™s consider the following versions of React:

- React 17
- React 18.2.0
- React 18.3.0

If hypothetically, the file `jsx-dev-runtime.js` will have the same content in all of these 3 versions, pnpm will store the file **once**.  
This approach greatly reduces the size of the `node_modules`, especially if you have multiple projects on your machine.

### More strict than npm

Pnpm is stricter than npm.  
When you install `@testing-library/jest-dom` with npm it will hoist all of its [dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom?activeTab=dependencies) to the root of the `node_modules`.  
Package `@testing-library/jest-dom` is shipped with a dependency `lodash` which, even if you don't use it in your project, can be still imported and used e.g

```typescript
// it will work since lodash is a dependency of the `@testing-library/jest-dom`
import lodash from 'lodash'
```

Although it is a rare case scenario, I have seen it in production apps, it is bad because:

- you have 0 control over the version of the `lodash` that `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- `lodash` is not your dependency listed in the `package.json`
- in case `@testing-library/jest-dom` removes `lodash` in the next version it will break your app

Lodash is hoisted because `npm` follows the flat module structure by default.

Let's take a look at how `pnpm` solves this problem:

- pnpm add only direct dependencies of your app to the `node_modules`
- your node_modules will only contain `@testing-library/jest-dom` in this example
- your app will break if you attempt to import `lodash` like in the npm example
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` will still have `lodash` to function properly. It will be stored in the `node_modules/.pnpm` directory

### How to migrate

1. install pnpm with the [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html)
2. rm -rf node_modules
3. rm `package-lock.json` - pnpm will create its own lock-file `pnpm-lock.yaml`
4. pnpm install
5. update ci workflow workflow

I use Github and Gitlab configs from the docs and had no issues so far.  
It's up to you whether to cache the store on CI.

<Alert variant="info">
  Typing `pnpm` in your terminal can be too verbose, you can always create an
  alias in shell config `.zshrc` alias pn=pnpm

### Metrics

During my migration to pnpm, I was using the `9.1.0` version of the pnpm.  
All of my checks were done with `time npm/pnpm i` on medium-sized Qwik City blog with a ton of mdx, and a fairly standard amount of dependencies.
Results showing average from the 5 runs of each command.

Without `node_modules`:

- total time **npm**: `3.374s`
- total time **pnpm**: `1.701s`

With `node_modules`:

- total time **npm**: `0.826s`
- total time **pnpm**: `0.591s`

GitHub actions:

- total install time **npm**: `16s`
- total install time **pnpm**: `13s`
  Additionally `pnpm` has to be installed, in my case it takes 1-2 seconds on GitHub action  

Size of the `node_modules` note that it's the only Qwik project on my computer:

- with **npm**: `260MB	node_modules/`
- with **pnpm**: `240MB	node_modules/`

### Monorepo

This article won't cover how `pnpm` handles the monorepo setups.  
I will cover it in an upcoming article, once I get more insights into it in my daily job.
